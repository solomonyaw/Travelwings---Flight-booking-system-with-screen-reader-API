# Travelwings - Flight booking system with screen reader API

I built this project during a semester course in Human Computer Interaction(HCI) at Valley View University. The main objective of this project is to build systems that are disability friendly. The system was built in order to enable the blind to better interact with web applications. Its a flight booking system with a Web Speech recognition and Screen reader API being intergated. 

# WEBREADER API INTEGRATION

WebReader is a free and open source JavaScript library developed for modern web browsers. Built using emerging functionality, WebReader can be integrated into any web page. Underneath, WebReader relies on the Web Speech API to offer speech recognition and speech synthesis functionality. It integrates a subset of the features provided by classic screen readers.

A major advantage of WebReader is that it does not require any additional software to be installed on a user's machine, apart from a supported web browser.

It is built with the hope to help users with disabilities better interact with web pages. The intention is not to replace screen readers, but with basic features embedded into a web page, any user with an internet connection and a headset will be able to browse a website. It frees people form constantly looking at the screen which is useful for anyone which is on the move

# WEB SPEECH API INTEGRATION
The Web Speech API makes web apps able to handle voice data. There are two components to this API:

Speech recognition is accessed via the SpeechRecognition interface, which provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input (normally via the device's default speech recognition service) and respond appropriately. Generally you'll use the interface's constructor to create a new SpeechRecognition object, which has a number of event handlers available for detecting when speech is input through the device's microphone. The SpeechGrammar interface represents a container for a particular set of grammar that your app should recognise. Grammar is defined using JSpeech Grammar Format (JSGF.)

Speech synthesis is accessed via the SpeechSynthesis interface, a text-to-speech component that allows programs to read out their text content (normally via the device's default speech synthesiser.) Different voice types are represented by SpeechSynthesisVoice objects, and different parts of text that you want to be spoken are represented by SpeechSynthesisUtterance objects. You can get these spoken by passing them to the SpeechSynthesis.speak() method.
