# Travelwings - Flight booking system with screen reader API

I built this project during my semester course in Computer Human Interaction(HCI). The main objective of this project is to build systems that are disability friendly. The system was built in order to enable the blind to better interact with web applications. Its a flight booking system with a Web Speech recognition and Screen reader API being intergated. 

# WEBREADER API INTEGRATION

WebReader is a free and open source JavaScript library developed for modern web browsers. Built using emerging functionality, WebReader can be integrated into any web page. Underneath, WebReader relies on the Web Speech API to offer speech recognition and speech synthesis functionality. It integrates a subset of the features provided by classic screen readers.

A major advantage of WebReader is that it does not require any additional software to be installed on a user's machine, apart from a supported web browser.

It is built with the hope to help users with disabilities better interact with web pages. The intention is not to replace screen readers, but with basic features embedded into a web page, any user with an internet connection and a headset will be able to browse a website. It frees people form constantly looking at the screen which is useful for anyone which is on the move
